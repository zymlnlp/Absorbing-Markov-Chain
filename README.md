# Absorbing-Markov-Chain



This software is mainly designed to solve Absorbing Markov Chain problem, a very important Mathematical theory of probability.

The algorithm backbone is implemented in a low-level structure. You can adopt the algorithm to other programming language by following the code structure.



You can run the program right from your terminal with the below instructions.

Note: If you want to modify the input matrix, please go to the [matrix_input.txt](https://github.com/zymlnlp/Absorbing-Markov-Chain/blob/master/matrix_input.txt) file and modify the matrix using the same structure as shown in the default matrix.



To run the software through [main.py](https://github.com/zymlnlp/Absorbing-Markov-Chain/blob/master/main.py) file:

```
python main.py
```
