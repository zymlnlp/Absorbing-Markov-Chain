# Absorbing-Markov-Chain



This software is mainly used to solve Absorbing Markov Chain problem.

You can run the algorithm right from your terminal with the below instructions.

If you want to modify the input matrix, please go to the [matrix_input.txt](https://github.com/zymlnlp/Absorbing-Markov-Chain/blob/master/matrix_input.txt) file and modify the matrix using the same structure as shown in the default matrix.

To run the software:

```
python main.py
```
